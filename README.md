Hi =)

The code has been refactored, partially written, and documented by ChatGPT, so don't be surprized (I am a mathematician, not a coder).

*The `.mat` files need to be in the `mat_converted_N={NN}`* folder, where `NN` is the resolution (that is, the volumes are $N \times N \times N$)

1. The script `final_cov_matr_centered.py` builds the globally centered covariance matrix ~~(three of them: uncentered, centered per volume, centered globally)~~. Then it expands each volume in the eigebasis of this matrix.

2. The script `final_plot_energy_PCA.py` plots the comparison graphs of the energy. *Currently should not be used --- I need to remove the uncentered stuff*

3. `final_top_eigenvolumes_reconstruct.py` takes the eigenvolumes generated by `final_cov_matr_centered.py` and generates `.mrc` files.

4. `final_volumes_reconstruction.py` approximates the target volumes (variable `TARGETS` in the code) using the top `K` eigenvolumes where `K` runs in `K_LIST`. Curently it also reconstructs the original, so it loads all coefficients, but we can remove that in the future.
